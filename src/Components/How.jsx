              Multimedia Engineer. I love the programming, special effects and
              2D/3D animation. IÂ´ve always loved solving problems, especially to
              design innovate and interactive contents, whether of computer
              graphics, animation, programming to deliver a memorable
              experience. Also with a great ability to learn new technologies,
              with a extensive leadership. I've always been fascinated with the
              idea of generating interactive content that provide a lifetime

              applications and websites.
